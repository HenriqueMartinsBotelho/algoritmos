#There are 5 different ways to prove that this shape is a parallelogram. Choose one of the methods.
#1 Show that both pairs of opposite sides are congruent.
#2 Show that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.
#3 Show that one pair of sides is parallel and congruent.
#4 Show that the diagonals bisect each other.
#4 Show that the opposite angles are congruent.

# In this example, we will show that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel.
# To do this we need to calculate the slope of each side.
# If we can show that the slopes of the opposite sides are the same, then the opposite
# sides are parallel.

#Step 2: Next, prove that the parallelogram is a rectangle.
#We can do this by showing that that the diagonals are congruent
# or by showing that one of the angles is a right angle.
#It may be easier to show that one of the angles is a right angle
# because we have already computed all of the slopes.

#If you multiply the slopes of two perpendicular lines in the plane, you get âˆ’1 . 
#That is, the slopes of perpendicular lines are opposite reciprocals .
